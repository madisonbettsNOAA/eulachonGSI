Eulachon (*Thaleichthys pacificus*, Osmeridae) are anadromous smelts that inhabit the North Pacific Ocean, from northern California to the southeastern Bering Sea along the coast of Alaska (Gustafson et al. 2012). Eulachon are an important food source for First Nation people (Kuhnlein et al. 1982; Joyce et al. 2004). A SNP panel was 

In collaboration with Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), the primary objective of this project was to identify what genetic stock eulachon bycatch samples caught by the pink shrimp fishery belong to. Specifically, we (1) selected a subset of ~1600 samples from bycatch caught from 2013-2022 for genetic stock ID (GSI), (2) refined  used GTseq (Genotyping-in-Thousands Sequencing)
